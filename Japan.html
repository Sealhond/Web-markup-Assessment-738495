                        Japanese film and TV is mostly known for anime these days, but while many anime are good and well-made, there are many more genres that modern international audiences are overlooking that are just as culturally significant. Japanese cinema has been around for over 100 years so it has gone through many trends and genres like period dramas or yakuza/gangster movies and now anime. Especially the 1950&rsquo;s, dubbed &lsquo;the golden age of Japanese cinema&rsquo;, were full of different types of movies by Akira Kurosawa, Masaki Kobayashi, Kenji Mizoguchi, Ishir&#333; Honda and Yasujir&#333; Ozu that would slowly gain traction on the world stage, especially after Kurosawa's &ldquo;Rashomon&rdquo; started winning awards. After this golden age the number of movie theaters in Japan started decreasing due to economic recessions until the 90&rsquo;s, thanks to new directors like Takeshi Kitano, Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki.

                    <h2>
                        Various films:
                    </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You may be familiar with &ldquo;Godzilla&rdquo;, in which a dinosaur-like beast, awoken from undersea hibernation by atom bomb testing, ravages Tokyo. A scientist must decide if his similarly dangerous weapon should be used to destroy it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &ldquo;Perfect Blue&rdquo; is an influential movie about a pop singer who gives up her career to become an actress, but she slowly goes insane when she starts being stalked by an obsessed fan and what seems to be a ghost of her past. This movie has influenced the more famous western movies &ldquo;Requiem for a Dream&rdquo; and especially &ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo;.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another must-watch is &ldquo;Tokyo Story&rdquo;, about the elderly Shukishi and his wife Tomi, who take the long journey from their small sesection village to visit their adult children in Tokyo. Their elder son, Koichi, a doctor, and their daughter, Shige, a hairdresser, don&rsquo;t have much time to spend with their aged parents, and so it falls to Noriko, the widow of their younger son who was killed in the war, to keep her in-laws company.

                    <h2>
                        Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998)
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Akira Kurosawa is one of the most prominent directors from Japan. Mostly famous for his samurai films, his beautiful cinematography and engaging storytelling are the reason the Japanese film industry is where it is today by getting international recognition and thus putting a foot in the door for other Japanese directors. His movies have influenced western filmmakers like Sergio Leone and have inspired works like the original Star Wars. Here are some recommendations:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Notable movies are the 3 1/2 hour long epic &ldquo;Seven Samurai&rdquo;, about farmers from a village exploited by bandits hiring a veteran samurai for protection, who gathers six other samurai to join him.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another good movie to start with is the thrilling and engaging crime drama &ldquo;High and Low&rdquo;, about an executive of a shoe company becoming a victim of extortion when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake and held for ransom, initiating a long police investigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For a more recent movie (and one in color), the beautifully colored war epic &ldquo;Ran&rdquo; should be mentioned, about an elderly warlord retiring, handing over his empire to his three sons. However, he vastly underestimates how the new-found power will corrupt them and cause them to turn on each other...and him..
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As Kurosawa had a long and very successful career, there are more than three movies to recommend, so i suggest watching these as well: &ldquo;Rashomon&rdquo; (1950), &ldquo;Ikiru&rdquo; (1952), &ldquo;The Hidden Fortress&rdquo; (1958), &ldquo;Yojimbo&rdquo; (1961) and &ldquo;Kagemusha&rdquo; (1980).

                    <img src="img/Hayaomiyazaki.png" alt="Picture of Hayao Miyazaki" title="Hayao Miyazaki" class="portrait"/>
                    <h2>
                        Hayao Miyazaki (1941)
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        One the most famous Japanese directors currently is Hayao Miyazaki. His studio, Ghibli, has consistently been putting out great animated movies, their mascot and most recognizable symbol is Totoro from their movie &ldquo;My Neighbour Totoro&rdquo;. Ghibli uses surreal and thought-provoking visuals to tell stories of people (usually children) in a confusing world learning to deal with life. Here are some recommendations:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I highly recommend his most famous movie &ldquo;Spirited Away&rdquo;, about a 10-year-old girl who during her family's move to the suburbs, wanders into a world ruled by gods, witches and spirits, where humans are changed into beasts. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, where she must call upon the courage she never knew she had to free her family.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another very popular one is &ldquo;My Neighbour Totoro&rdquo;, in which two sisters move to the country with their father in order to be closer to their hospitalized mother, and discover the surrounding trees are inhabited by Totoros, magical spirits of the forest. When the youngest runs away from home, the older sister seeks help from the spirits to find her.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally i recommend my personal favourite: &ldquo;Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle&rdquo; is about Sophie, a young milliner, who is turned into an elderly woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She encounters a wizard named Howl and gets caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king.

                    <p>
                        Just like Kurosawa, Miyazaki has had a long career so far, which means having three movies on this list doesn&rsquo;t cut it, so i also recommend: &ldquo;Castle in the Sky&rdquo; (1986), &ldquo;Kiki&rsquo;s Delivery Service&rdquo; (1989), &ldquo;Porco Rosso&rdquo; (1992), &ldquo;Princess Mononoke&rdquo; (1997), &ldquo;Ponyo&rdquo; (2008) and &ldquo;The Boy and the Heron&rdquo; (2023).
